## Project Explanation. 
Implementation of a parser for Python language, using Context-free Grammar (CFG) or BNF with ANTLR (or something equivalent to ANTLR, for example, bison, yacc, lex, etc.). 

## Team members. 
* Malek Necibi
* Romelo Seals
* Akhil Mulakala
* Andy Solovyov
* Tasha Ogoti


## Requirements for your parser
* Steps for the setup
  TBD
* Environment is Needed? 
  TBD

## How to use/run the parser. 
TBD

## Optional: Demo video 
TBD


## Expected Features
### Deliverable #1
\t * Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %,) 
\t * Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=) 
\t * Variable definitions 
 
### Deliverable #2 
\t * if/else blocks 
\t * Conditional statements (<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, 
and, or, not) 

### Deliverable #3 
\t * while and for Loops 
\t * Support for comments 

### Deliverable #4 
\t * Support for function implementations 
\t * Function calls 

### BONUS
\t * Visualization of your parse tree, and 
outputting in image format (.png, .jpeg, .jpg, 
.pdf).
