## Project Explanation. 
Implementation of a parser for Python language, using Context-free Grammar (CFG) or BNF with ANTLR (or something equivalent to ANTLR, for example, bison, yacc, lex, etc.).

## Expected Features
### Deliverable #1
• Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %,) 
• Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=) 
• Variable definitions 
 
### Deliverable #2 
• if/else blocks 
• Conditional statements (<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, 
and, or, not) 

### Deliverable #3 
• while and for Loops 
• Support for comments 

### Deliverable #4 
• Support for function implementations 
• Function calls 

### BONUS
• Visualization of your parse tree, and 
outputting in image format (.png, .jpeg, .jpg, 
.pdf).
