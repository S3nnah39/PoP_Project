## Project Explanation. 
Implementation of a parser for Python language, using Context-free Grammar (CFG) or BNF with ANTLR (or something equivalent to ANTLR, for example, bison, yacc, lex, etc.). [DOC LINK](https://umsystem.instructure.com/courses/113343/files/14720691?module_item_id=5446317)

## Requirements for your parser
* Requirements for the setup
1. Apache Maven 3.8.4
2. JavaSE 17

* Steps for the setup
  TBD
  
* Environment is Needed? 
  TBD

## How to use/run the parser. 
Refer to ANTLR documentation for instructions on running parser for g4 file. The g4 file is Expr.g4.
